# Modern SOTA CNN Architectures

## Learning Objectives:

Upon completing this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **Build Important Blocks for Modern CNNs:**
    - Gain practical experience in building key blocks used in modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
        - Implement Residual connections to facilitate the training of deep networks.
        - Incorporate Batch Normalization for improved training stability and faster convergence.
        - Utilize Depthwise Separable Convolution for efficient model architecture.

2. **Interpret What CNNs Learn:**
    - Develop skills in interpreting and visualizing what CNNs learn.
        - Visualize activations to understand the active regions in the network.
        - Explore visualizing filters to comprehend the learned features by individual filters.
        - Generate heatmaps to highlight the crucial areas of focus in the input images.
